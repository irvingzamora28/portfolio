## Hey there! 👋

Ever wished you could build your own smart assistant or automate research with AI, but felt overwhelmed by all the jargon? Good news: OpenAI Agents SDK makes it way easier than you think. In this post, I’ll walk you through the basics, show you some code, and share tips so you can start building cool agent-powered apps in Python—no PhD required!

---

## What’s an “Agent,” Anyway?

Think of an agent as a Python-powered digital helper. It can:
- Understand instructions
- Use tools (like calling APIs or running your functions)
- Work alone or as part of a team

With OpenAI Agents SDK, you can create agents that answer questions, fetch data, or even collaborate to solve bigger problems.

---

## Why Use the OpenAI Agents SDK?

- **Super simple:** Write regular Python functions and let the agent use them as tools.
- **Flexible:** Connect to OpenAI models and many other LLMs.
- **Teamwork:** Build workflows where agents hand off tasks to each other.
- **Debugging made easy:** Built-in tracing helps you see what your agents are thinking.

---

## Installation

Make sure you’re using Python 3.8 or newer. Then, just run:

```bash
pip install openai-agents
```

Want voice features too? Try:

```bash
pip install openai-agents[voice]
```

## Creating Your First Agent

Let’s build a weather bot together. This agent will answer questions about the weather—using a function you define.

```python
from openai_agents import Agent, Runner, function_tool
import asyncio

@function_tool
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    # In real life, you’d call a weather API here!
    return f"The weather in {city} is sunny."

agent = Agent(
    name="WeatherBot",
    instructions="You’re a helpful weather assistant.",
    tools=[get_weather],
)

async def main():
    result = await Runner.run(agent, input="What's the weather in Tokyo?")
    print(result.final_output)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**What’s happening here?**
- You write a normal Python function (`get_weather`).
- The agent uses your function as a tool.
- You ask the agent a question, and it figures out when to call your function!

## Advanced: Multi-Agent Systems (with Real Handoffs)

Let’s go beyond single agents—let’s build a real multi-agent workflow, where agents can hand off tasks to each other!

Suppose you want to triage messages in different languages and delegate to the right specialist. Here’s how you can do that step by step:

```python
from openai_agents import Agent, Runner
import asyncio

# Create two specialist agents
spanish_agent = Agent(
    name="SpanishAgent",
    instructions="You only speak Spanish."
)

english_agent = Agent(
    name="EnglishAgent",
    instructions="You only speak English."
)

# Create a triage agent that delegates based on language
triage_agent = Agent(
    name="TriageAgent",
    instructions="Delegate to the appropriate agent based on the language of the message.",
    handoffs=[spanish_agent, english_agent],
)

async def main():
    result = await Runner.run(triage_agent, input="Hola, ¿cómo estás?")
    print(result.final_output)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**What’s happening here?**
- We create two specialist agents: one for Spanish, one for English.
- The `TriageAgent` receives a message and decides which specialist should handle it—using the `handoffs` parameter.
- When you run this, the triage agent will delegate the Spanish message to the Spanish agent, and you’ll see the response in Spanish!

You can expand this pattern for more complex workflows: chain agents, pass outputs, and build true multi-agent systems that collaborate to solve big problems.

---

## Best Practices

- **Start simple:** One agent, one tool. Build up from there.
- **Be clear:** Give your agents detailed, friendly instructions.
- **Test often:** Use tracing to understand and improve your agents’ reasoning.
- **Have fun!** The best way to learn is to experiment.

---

## Debugging & Tracing: See Inside Your Agents’ Heads

Worried about what your agent is doing under the hood? The SDK includes tracing tools that let you visualize each step, so you can debug or optimize your workflows without guesswork.

## Conclusion

OpenAI Agents SDK makes building smart, collaborative Python agents surprisingly friendly. Whether you want to automate research, build a chatbot, or just tinker, you’ve got the tools—and now, the know-how.

If you build something cool, let me know! 🚀
