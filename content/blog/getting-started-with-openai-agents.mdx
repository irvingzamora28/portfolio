## Introduction to OpenAI Agents

OpenAI Agents is a powerful Python library that enables developers to build intelligent agents that can perform complex tasks by breaking them down into manageable steps. These agents can leverage OpenAI's language models to understand context, make decisions, and execute actions in both digital and real-world environments.

Agents are particularly useful for:
- Automating complex workflows
- Building AI assistants
- Creating research assistants
- Developing customer support systems
- Implementing data processing pipelines

## Key Features

1. **Modular Design**: Build agents with specific capabilities and chain them together
2. **Tool Integration**: Connect to external APIs, databases, and services
3. **Memory Management**: Maintain context across interactions
4. **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple agents concurrently
5. **Observability**: Monitor agent behavior and decision-making

## Installation

To get started, you'll need Python 3.8 or higher. Install the OpenAI Agents SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install openai-agents
```

## Creating Your First Agent

Let's create a simple agent that can answer questions about current events:

```python
from openai_agents import Agent, run_agent

# Initialize the agent
agent = Agent(
    name="Research Assistant",
    instructions="You are a helpful research assistant. Use available tools to find accurate information."
)

# Run the agent
response = run_agent(
    agent=agent,
    input_text="What are the latest developments in AI?",
    tools=["web_search", "document_retrieval"]
)

print(response)
```

## Advanced: Multi-Agent Systems

For more complex tasks, you can create multiple specialized agents that work together:

```python
from openai_agents import Agent, MultiAgentSystem

# Create specialized agents
researcher = Agent(
    name="Researcher",
    instructions="Find and summarize information from reliable sources"
)

analyst = Agent(
    name="Analyst",
    instructions="Analyze the information and provide insights"
)

writer = Agent(
    name="Writer",
    instructions="Create well-structured reports based on the analysis"
)

# Create a multi-agent system
research_team = MultiAgentSystem(
    agents=[researcher, analyst, writer],
    workflow=[
        (researcher, "Gather information about {topic}"),
        (analyst, "Analyze the research: {researcher.output}"),
        (writer, "Write a report based on: {analyst.output}")
    ]
)

# Run the system
report = research_team.run("The impact of AI on software development")
print(report)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with a single agent and add complexity gradually
2. **Clear Instructions**: Provide detailed instructions for each agent's role
3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for API calls
4. **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of API rate limits
5. **Cost Management**: Monitor token usage to control costs

## Conclusion

OpenAI Agents provide a powerful framework for building sophisticated AI applications. By leveraging the modular architecture and integration capabilities, you can create intelligent systems that automate complex tasks and provide valuable insights.
