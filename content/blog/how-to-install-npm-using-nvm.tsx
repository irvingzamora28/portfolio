    {text: `Installing Node Package Manager (NPM) is an essential step when working with Node.js projects. It is a powerful tool that helps to install and manage packages in your projects. One way to install NPM is by using Node Version Manager (NVM), **which** is a tool that helps manage different versions of Node.js.`, element: `p`},
    {text: `Here are some of the key benefits of installing NPM with NVM:`, element: `p`},
    {text: `**Easy version management**: NVM allows you to easily install and switch between different versions of Node.js and NPM on your system, making it easy to test your code against different versions and ensure compatibility with your project's dependencies.`, element: `li`},
    {text: `**Better package management**: NVM makes it easier to manage your project dependencies by allowing you to install different versions of NPM for different projects, ensuring that each project uses the specific version of NPM that it needs.`, element: `li`},
    {text: `**Improved stability**: By using NVM to manage your Node.js and NPM versions, you can avoid conflicts between different versions of Node.js and NPM on your system, which can lead to instability and crashes.`, element: `li`},
    {text: `In this article, we will go through the steps to install NPM using NVM.`, element: `p`},
    {text: `Step 1: Install NVM`, element: `span`, id: `elem2`, class: `blog_subtitle`},
    {text: `The first step is to install NVM if you haven't already. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:`, element: `p`},
    {text: `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash`, element: `code`, language: `bash`},
    {text: `This will download and run the NVM installation script, which will add NVM to your system and update your shell profile.`, element: `p`},
    {text: `After the installation is complete, you can verify that NVM is installed by running the following command:`, element: `p`},
    {text: `nvm --version`, element: `code`, language: `bash`},
    {text: `This should output the version of NVM that you just installed.`, element: `p`},
    {text: `Step 2: Install Node.js`, element: `span`, id: `elem2`, class: `blog_subtitle`},
    {text: `Now that you have NVM installed, you can use it to install the latest version of Node.js by running the following command:`, element: `p`},
    {text: `nvm install node`, element: `code`, language: `bash`},
    {text: `This will download and install the latest version of Node.js and set it as the default version. You can verify that Node.js is installed by running the following command:`, element: `p`, language: `bash`},
    {text: `node --version`, element: `code`, language: `bash`},
    {text: `This should output the version of Node.js that you just installed.`, element: `p`},
    {text: `Step 3: Install NPM`, element: `span`, id: `elem2`, class: `blog_subtitle`},
    {text: `Now that Node.js is installed, you can install NPM alongside it by running the following command:`, element: `p`},
    {text: `This will download and install the latest latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version of NPM and associate it with the Node.js version you just installed. You can verify that NPM is installed by running the following command:`, element: `p`},
    {text: `npm --version`, element: `code`, language: `bash`},
    {text: `This should output the version of NPM that you just installed.`, element: `p`},
    {text: `Step 4: Update NPM`, element: `span`, id: `elem2`, class: `blog_subtitle`},
    {text: `If you want to update NPM to the latest version, you can run the following command:`, element: `p`},
    {text: `nvm install-latest-npm`, element: `code`, language: `bash`},
    {text: `This will update NPM to the latest version and make it available for use.`, element: `p`},
    {text: `And that's it! You've now installed NPM using NVM, and can easily manage your Node.js packages without worrying about conflicting dependencies or version compatibility issues.`, element: `p`},
